The first youth conference on the topic of digital literacy, AI and digital responsibility. On November 17 and 18, a large number of motivated and interested people came together to discuss these topics.

The event began with an open welcome including a vegetarian and vegan buffet. While most of the bar tables were empty at the beginning, the room filled up more and more until the kick-off began.

Various presenters gave a short teaser on their main topics. They included

* What does digital literacy mean in concrete terms?
* AI and security
* In which areas is AI useful and feasible?
* Education and communication in computer science

And then it started. Information, impressions, ideas and opinions were exchanged in small groups of 7 or 20 participants, depending on their interests. Once heads were spinning and mouths were full, it was time for the evening program. The evening slowly faded away in a relaxed atmosphere.

The next day we continued at a very humane time. After 5 hours of brainstorming, discussion and lots of ideas for solutions, the final question was: How do we present this now? After all, the questions and solutions that emerged at this conference were passed on directly to politicians. The hope is that we can really make a difference!

A wide variety of presentations were created:

A rather counter-intuitive form of presentation at a conference on digital literacy: three large posters. But even that is a statement. After all, digital literacy also involves knowing how to use digital presentations sensibly and when not to use them. Posters were a good solution to see at a glance which different paths can be taken for which different players in the future.

In a large stand-up, around 14 voices each highlighted where AI could achieve an improvement and what security issues we are facing. This was followed by a fishbowl: four chairs in a circle, two of which were occupied from the outset. One of the people sitting in the circle starts with a 30-second input. Anyone who wants to say something is invited to sit on a free chair. Anyone who has nothing more to say is welcome to vacate their seat in the circle. Of course, we also talked about how artificial intelligence takes over the world in the dystopia...

Gender and diversity in computer science. Breaking down this huge topic into three to five key points is a challenge. Of course, not all personal experiences are taken into account. Nevertheless, the task force was finally able to reach an agreement and even formulate recommendations for action.

Last but not least, the keyword was IT education. Various alpacas were presented here. These included the fictional characters Peter, 45 years old, who is promoted to a position in which he suddenly needs software skills, or Julie, 16, who is completely underchallenged in IT lessons. The conclusion: a broad-based educational program is needed to provide all the characters with the right technical skills.

And why alpacas? This conference in Dresden was mainly organized by Jugend Hackt. The colorful mascot is of course very present. As mentors from CoderDojo, the exchange was a lot of fun and gave us new ideas, and we look forward to staying in touch with Jugend hackt in the future.
