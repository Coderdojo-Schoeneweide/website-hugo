In the online workshop "Hello Bot, how are you?" participants will gain insight into how to program chatbots.
Chatbots are programs capable of conversing with a user. Participants can choose to use either Scratch or Python.

Depending on the participants' progress, when using Scratch, they can also utilize the "Text-to-Speech" extension and create their own blocks (also known as "functions" or "subroutines").

Learning objectives:

* Participants understand what a chatbot is.
* Participants can make the computer say something.
* Participants can query and use user input.
* Participants can use conditions to respond to user input.


Participants will need:

* Computer or tablet.
* Internet connection.
* For working with Scratch: Browser (Chrome) or Scratch App.
* For working with Python: A Python editor, such as PyCharm or online in the browser trinket.
* Microphone and speakers.
* Paper and pens.
