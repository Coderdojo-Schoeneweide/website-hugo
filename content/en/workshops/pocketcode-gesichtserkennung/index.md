In the online workshop "Photo filter app", participants gain an insight into
how to programme intelligent photo filters, so-called "lenses", such as those found on Instagram or SnapChat.
PocketCode, an app for mobile devices that can be used to programme apps, is used for this.
After a short, creative warm-up exercise in which the participants design four filters on different topics in a short space of time,
together with their mentor, parents or alone, the participants use the instructions we have put together to create their own photo filter.
