In the online workshop "mBot Obstacle Course," participants navigate an mBot through an obstacle course.
After a programming phase, two teams compete against each other: Who can be the first to burst the balloon in the middle of the course? 
Line and proximity sensors are used for traversing the course.

The mBlock programs for controlling the mBots are shared by the participants with on-site mentors, who then execute the programs.
Since the mBots are captured by a camera mounted on the ceiling, participants can follow live to see if their program is working.

Learning objectives:
* Participants know what an mBot is.
* Participants can control the movement of an mBot using pre-made functions. 
* Participants can use conditions and loops.
* Participants can use the proximity sensor.
* Participants can use the line sensor.

Participants will need: 
* computer or tablets
* an [mBlock-Planet](https://planet.mblock.cc/) account
* browser or mBlock app
* microphone and speakers
* paper and pens
* [mBot project template from CoderDojo Sch√∂neweide](https://ide.mblock.cc/#/?cloudProjectId=410219)
