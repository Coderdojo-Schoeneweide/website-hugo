In the "Pet App" workshop, participants get an insight into how to program a digital pet that gets hungry and needs to be fed. OctoStudio is used for this purpose, which is an app for mobile devices that allows you to program apps. After a short round of inspiration, participants, together with their mentors, parents, or alone, use the guide provided by us to program a basic pet app and get to know OctoStudio. In the remaining time, participants can then expand their app.

Learning objectives:

* Participants can operate OctoStudio.
* Participants can add characters and backgrounds.
* Participants can change the visibility of a character.
* Participants can use variables.
* Participants can use random numbers.


Participants will need:

* smartphone or tablet
* to install the app "OctoStudio" (available on Google Play or the App Store)
* paper and pens
* [Instruction from CoderDojo Sch√∂neweide](https://coderdojo-schoeneweide.github.io/docs/anleitung-octostudio-haustierapp.pdf)
