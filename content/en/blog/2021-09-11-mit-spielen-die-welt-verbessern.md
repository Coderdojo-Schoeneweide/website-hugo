We from CoderDojo Schöneweide also offered a volunteer workshop at the Treptow-Köpenick Volunteer Days as part of the Berlin Volunteer Days. On Saturday morning, 11.09.21, everything revolved around how we can improve the world with games. There are two questions we need to answer. Firstly, what does it actually mean to make the world a better place? Secondly, how can we do this with games? To approach these questions naturally, we first discussed our favorite games.

“And do your favorite games have anything to do with our society?” Good question! For some, it's obvious, e.g. when it comes to club sports or team games. For others, the social connection is less easy to find. But no problem at all - in our workshop, everyone could learn programming for themselves. In this way, everyone used their own ideas to playfully implement topics that affect us as a society. We proceeded step by step together: From design - to sketch - to prototype.

Unfortunately, 2 hours were far too short to implement all the cool ideas. Nevertheless, the first games were created. Who is going to revive a dried up forest? Chase treasure hunters through the whole city and ensure safety in your neighborhood, or fish garbage out of the ocean as a jellyfish. You can find even more ideas on [our Instagram channel](https://www.instagram.com/dojosw/).

We were delighted with the lively participation. We are looking forward to our next workshop!
