Last week, we met again on the Wilhelminenhof campus of HTW Berlin and let the children program a chatbot with the help of Scratch.
Once all the children had found their way to us, we got started after a short round of introductions and the question “What is your favorite robot (Bender Futurama!)”.

The children got to grips well with the week's topic. The first attempts to design a chatbot were accomplished with the support of mentors.

Which avatar would you choose for your chatbot?

Since no one was working with Scratch for the first time, everyone eagerly programmed a chatbot according to their own ideas and learned about the concept of variables.
Among all the talking robots, you could also see flying footballs or aliens on the screens.

At the end, everyone was able to present their own project to the group. There were chatbots that talked to you in Vietnamese, cats that joked with you, aliens that dodged flying rockets and footballs that scored a goal.
