In the "It speaks!" workshop, participants will gain an insight into
how to make fluid animations consisting of individual images with Scratch.
In this type of animation, several images are played one after the other,
so that a kind of "film" is created in the mind - like a flip book, but digital!
Lip synchronisation is a special type of frame-by-frame animation: a digital figure moves its mouth
A digital figure moves the mouth so that the movements match the words spoken.

Learning objectives:
* Participants can make sound recordings with Scratch.
* Participants will be able to create simple graphics using the Scratch graphics editor.
* Participants can programmatically control the costumes of a character in Scratch.
* Participants will understand the relationship between the letters spoken and the position of the lip and tongue.

Participants need:
* Computer or tablet
* Internet connection and browser or Scratch app
* Microphone and loudspeaker
* Paper and pens
