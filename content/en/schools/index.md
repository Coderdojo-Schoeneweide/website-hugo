## Workshops für teachers
Do you have a class set of robots collecting dust in the closet because no one knows how to use them?
Or are you lacking ideas on what to do with the new tablets?

In workshops and in-school training sessions (SchiF), we help you and your colleagues learn to shape the digital world yourselves and to pass on your new skills directly in class.

### Are interested in an in-school training session?
Great! If you can imagine conducting your own in-service training session with us, which is also creditable as further education, send us an [email](mailto:schoeneweide.berlin@coderdojo.com).

## Workshops for school classes
We offer programming workshops for school classes.

We tailor the content to the needs of your class.
Following the motto "anything is possible," we combine digital skills such as programming and animation with your subject and curriculum.
You can also find inspiration under "[Workshops](..%2Fworkshops)".

We can accommodate all grade levels and experience levels, with only reading skills being required.
Our workshops for school classes usually last three hours, spread over one or two days.
Exceptions are possible in exceptional cases. 

### Are you interested in a school class workshop?
Send us an [email](mailto:schoeneweide.berlin@coderdojo.com) with information about your framework conditions (grade level, number of students, available technology, available space, school, prior knowledge) and your existing ideas and concepts. We will then contact you with a proposed date for an initial discussion.
Once all framework conditions and the rough workshop content are clarified, we will send your school an offer.

If you accept this, we will refine our concept for you and prepare everything in consultation with you.
Then we will conduct the workshop, and afterwards your school will receive an invoice, payable by bank transfer.



### Costs
Money shouldn't be a barrier to digital education.
The compensation for our offerings for schools is based on the school's budget.
No budget? We'll see what we can do. Send us an [email](mailto:schoeneweide.berlin@coderdojo.com).
