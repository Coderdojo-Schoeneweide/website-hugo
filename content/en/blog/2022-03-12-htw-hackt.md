In movies, hackers often sit in dark rooms, shrouded in eternal night. Our workshop in cooperation with HTW Hackt showed that there is another way: it was a sunny Saturday afternoon, blue skies and bright rooms in which our ninjas could train.
The topic this time was XSS, which stands for cross-site scripting and simply put means executing code on websites via input fields.

Since you can't just hack in everywhere, the people from HTW Hackt created a website themselves, which the participants were allowed to explore. And with success! In the end, everyone was able to “steal” each other's secrets stored on the profile and change background images on the website.

It was all pretty exciting and if you're thinking: “I'd like to do that too, but I don't know anything about websites or hacking or anything else! :(" - Don't worry! During the workshop, all the important terms were explained and even demonstrated live where possible.

The time flew by and we could probably have gone on like this for another two hours. Many thanks to Lara, Felix and Felix from HTW Hackt for this exciting collaboration!
