In the online workshop "Improving the world as a software developer", participants gain an initial insight into working as a software developer.
In the first part, the participants deal with topics that are close to their hearts, such as climate protection or equal rights,
and think together about how software influences society. In the next step, the participants design a piece of software that draws attention to a social issue
or that addresses a social problem. Finally, the participants are allowed to realise part of the idea using Scratch.

Learning objectives:
* Participants know what software is and can give examples
* Participants have an impression of what a software developer does
* Participants understand that the profession of software developer is a profession with social responsibility
* Participants know the basic building blocks of software development: Idea - Design - Development - Test
* Participants can use Scratch to realise small ideas

Participants need:
* Computer or tablet
* Internet connection
* Browser (Chrome) or Scratch app
* Microphone and speakers
* Pen and paper
