We have recently given some thought to how we want to organize our cooperation in the team of the
CoderDojo team as well as in workshops and other events we organize. The result of this
have been recorded in our new Code of Conduct!

Our Code of Conduct consists of three parts: General principles of conduct, conduct towards team colleagues and
Behavior towards children and young people. The general part defines rules that we would like to see in our dealings
with each other. This includes, for example, respectful behavior, dealing constructively with mistakes and
diversity in word and deed. In the team part, we place particular emphasis on clear and open communication with each other and
independent work. When working with children and young people, a responsible approach is particularly important to us.
important to us. We want to respect the rights of children and young people and their individual boundaries. Furthermore
we want to serve as positive role models and encourage them in their development.

With this code, we hope to make our communal interaction pleasant for everyone and to make our events a great experience.
a great experience.

If you would like to have a look at the full version of the code of conduct, you can now of course also find it
