On March 4, we held the *Processing-Worksop*. We looked at the program “*Processing*” with children aged 12 and over - for many it was their first time programming with text. How exciting! And really well mastered.

[](<>)The aim of the workshop was to provide a fun introduction to programming by using *Processing* to create images and animations. Participants were given a brief introduction to the color theory of the RGB system as used by computer screens.

Using our sample color picker, everyone was able to explore the principle for themselves and then it was time to get started! Now it was time to either solve a few puzzles from us or to explore the programming language on their own.

By the end of the workshop, the participants had all programmed their own images and some of them had already created animations. It was impressive to see how quickly the children found their way around the program and how enthusiastically they acquired more and more new functions.

The results were really great. Many thanks to everyone for the great time!
