organized workshops on site. Our energetic mentors played and programmed together with the children

First, however, the children were able to try things out, practise controlling the Dash robots and of course
also play with the robots. The mentors set up various stations for the robots, such as a football pitch, a maze and much more.
a soccer field, a labyrinth and much more.

The children quickly got into the spirit of collecting and wanted to get all the stickers that were up for grabs for each task.
Children of different ages tried their luck at programming the little robots together with a mentor.
which was sometimes not so easy. But as a team, almost all participants mastered the challenges
and got all the stickers! Bravo!

Overall, the atmosphere was relaxed, fun and playful. The children had a lot of fun and the
parents could relax a bit and ask questions to the mentors. We at CoderDojo Schöneweide think that both workshops
workshops were a complete success and we look forward to being represented at the FEZ Berlin again soon. Our thanks also go
also to FEZ Berlin for providing us with the Dash robots and tablets!
