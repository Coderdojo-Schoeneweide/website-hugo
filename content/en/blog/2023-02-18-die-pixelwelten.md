On two weekends, February 11 and 12 and February 18 and 19, kids were able to make their own VR goggles, design PixelArt or play Jump'n'Run SuperMario live in the gym at the FEZ leisure and recreation center.

We took part in the CoderDojo on the 11th and 12th with two workshops each entitled “Robot competitions”.

We didn't really have anything to do with competitions. Instead, similar to the crazy lab in November, there were a wide variety of challenges that had to be mastered with DashBots. These included a labyrinth stuck to the floor, a soccer pitch, a theater round and the - very popular - catapult. The Dashbot can be controlled once at each station using a 2D joystick or programmed in the app.

All workshops were fully booked in no time at all. Unfortunately, there were only 6 robots. Sharing and taking turns, all well and good, but four people on a tablet + dashbot? You have to wait forever for your turn. Nevertheless, those who were patient enough had a lot of fun and hopefully also learned something. :-)

We certainly had both. A lot of fun, all in all a successful event. Even better next time: several shorter workshops, but smaller groups. Until then!
