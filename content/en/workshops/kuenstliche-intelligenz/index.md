In the "Artificial Intelligence" workshop, participants explore how AI works and what this technology can be used for.
Using the [Monkey Game](https://www.aiunplugged.org/german.pdf) as an example, participants discover how AI "learns." 
Then, with the help of the website [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/)  they can train and experiment with AI themselves.
The model can also be used in Scratch at the end.

Learning objectives:
* Participants know what AI is.
* Participants know how AI can be trained.
* Participants are familiar with some applications of AI.

Participants will need:
* a computer. 
* an internet connection.
