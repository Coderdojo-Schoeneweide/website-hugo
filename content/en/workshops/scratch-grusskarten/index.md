In the online workshop "Making digital greeting cards", participants will gain an insight into
how to make animations with Scratch and create beautiful digital greeting cards.
The animations are created through the movement, costume changes and graphic effects of characters in Scratch.
Depending on the progress of the participants, other means of animation can also be used, such as cloning figures or using the "colouring pen".

Learning objectives:
* Participants can play sounds in Scratch
* Participants can create simple graphics using the Scratch graphics editor.
* Participants will be able to programmatically control the costumes of a character in Scratch.

Participants need:
* Computer or tablet
* Internet connection
* Browser (Chrome) or Scratch app
* Microphone and loudspeaker
* Paper and pens
