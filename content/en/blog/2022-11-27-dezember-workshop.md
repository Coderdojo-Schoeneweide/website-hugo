On November 26, the workshop “It speaks!” took place, in which participants practiced animating with Scratch.
They were able to speak a word, e.g. the name of their favorite desert, play it back with Scratch
and then animate the lip movements of a stick figure to match.

With the help of our Lip Sync toolkit, the participants were quickly able to enjoy their first successes.

After we had previously held this workshop online, this was the first time it could take place in person.
