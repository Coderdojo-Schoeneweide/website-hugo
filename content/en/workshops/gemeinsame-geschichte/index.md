In the "Shared Story" workshop, participants first learn what programming is. With the game "Living Robot," they get to know the basics of algorithmic thinking. Then, they can take their first steps in programming with Scratch and get to know the programming environment.

Separately from the workshop (e.g., in German and art classes), participants choose a story (e.g., a myth they have studied). This story is divided into small sections and distributed among participant groups. Participants illustrate the characters and objects from the story. These graphics are scanned and inserted into a template project.

Using this template project, the groups then continue to program their scene.

In the end, all parts are put together, resulting in a jointly programmed story.

Learning objectives:

* Participants can set costumes and backgrounds in Scratch.
* Participants can move characters in Scratch.
* Participants can make characters speak with speech bubbles in Scratch.
* Participants can make characters speak with sound in Scratch.
* Participants can formulate simple sequences (algorithms).
* Participants can use Scratch to create a simple animation.


Participants will need:

* computer or tablet
* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) installed
* an internet connection
* paper and pen
