We, the CoderDojo Schöneweide, organized a voluntary workshop on 20.11.21 at the HTW Berlin on the Wilhelminenhof campus.

Under the motto “Between Beetles and Building Blocks”, our little ladybird Kara and our brick figure Robot Karol helped us to understand the world of programming and algorithms. Kara and Robot Karol are programming environments designed for children and young people.

After a brief introduction to Kara, the children were able to get to know and operate the program independently. For example, Kara the ladybird can move mushrooms or sit on clover leaves and place them in other places.

Robot Karol, with which the children were able to move the brick figure using predefined instructions and control structures, also aroused great interest. For example, Robot Karol can be programmed to lay down different colored bricks and walk on them. He can also turn in circles or run through a self-created maze - many things are possible and there are hardly any limits to the imagination!

Fortunately, there were enough of our mentors on site so that each child had their own mentor. The children had lots of interesting and exciting ideas that they wanted to put into practice.

The two hours flew by and the children created exciting little projects. Towards the end of the workshop, there was a short showtime where the children were able to present their projects.

At the end there was a little quiz! We love quizzes! Our mentors asked questions and the children then had the opportunity to put the knowledge they had acquired in the workshop to the test. And what can we say? No question was challenging enough for our young participants! All questions were answered quickly.

We from CoderDojo Schöneweide had a lot of fun and we look forward to welcoming and supporting you again soon in one of our workshops!
