On 17.05.2023 and 24.05.2023 we were at the Karlshorst elementary school and organized a Scratch workshop on the topic of sagas together with the 6th grade students.

On May 17th, after a short introduction, we started directly with the robot game. The pupils were faced with the difficult task of programming our robot Ilja so that he could satisfy his hunger for toast with peanut butter. This required many intermediate steps, such as unwrapping the toast and inserting the knife into the peanut butter. The latter ensured that the knife ended up knob first in the jar of peanut butter. In the end, however, Ilya was still able to eat the toast after successful programming.

After a brief introduction to Scratch, the students got straight down to animating their own ideas and concepts. For some, it was their first experience with Scratch, while others had already programmed with Scratch before the workshop.

The time flew by and at the end the students presented their programs to the class.

In preparation for the second part of the workshop, the pupils had chosen the legend of King Midas and divided it into 13 sections. They also drew the characters, props and backgrounds that appear in the story.

On May 24, the students had the goal of animating the Midas saga in Scratch. After the welcome, the groups were formed, each animating a part of the saga.

The self-painted figures, props and backgrounds were used for this. At the end there was another showtime in which all the groups presented their results. After putting all the sections together, a complete animation of the Midas saga was created.

We all had a lot of fun and the saga also had an individual touch thanks to the self-drawn motifs.
