Sometimes you try to explain something to your child, but it just doesn't click? With us, it's all about having fun. That's why it's important for you as a parent to support your child optimally.

Consider:

- your child's individual learning style, including factors like concentration and their own problem-solving methods.
- your child wants to pursue their own project, not yours!
- feel free to assist with problems through targeted questions.
- sometimes, just showing that parents make mistakes too is enough. ;)
