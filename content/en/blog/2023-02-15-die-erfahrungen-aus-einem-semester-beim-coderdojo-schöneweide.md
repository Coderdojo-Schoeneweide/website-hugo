In the following lines, I would like to share my impressions of CoderDojo Schöneweide, which I received during the winter semester 22/23.
I myself am a student at the HTW and came to the CoderDojo via the selection list of the HTW's AWE modules.

My first impressions were of some really friendly people who are enthusiastic and enjoy what they do.
As well as working on the well thought out workshops, there is a lot going on behind the scenes here.
The impressions I want to share here are just some of those hidden activities that turn into wonderful experiences for children and CoderDojo members alike.

The training and support from the more experienced members is regularly passed on to the newcomers via further training and guidelines.
This made it easy to get started and also left a positive feeling of having been well received.
The regular meetings are a really helpful point of contact, especially when it comes to working together.

The assignment I was given this semester was for a video in which the CoderDojo introduces itself.
My contribution was to create and record the text for this video.
In addition to the fun we had, I realized how often a sentence has to be repeated until it sounds the way it should.

Working at CoderDojo Schöneweide can be recommended if you set yourself goals and stick to them.
The opportunities to help are as varied as they are numerous.

I hope to remain a voice at CoderDojo Schöneweide for a while and thank the members for giving me the opportunity to try things out for myself.

Keep up your enthusiasm, everyone,
Karsten
