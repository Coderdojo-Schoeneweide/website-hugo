In the online workshop "Astro Pi - Code in Space" as part of the
project ["Mission Zero" of the RaspberryPi Foundation](https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero/), participants will be given the opportunity to write a Python programme,
to write a Python programme that will then be played on the ISS. Participants can create an animation lasting a maximum of 30 seconds,
in which at least the humidity on the ISS is displayed. In addition, participants can greet the astronauts, display the air pressure and temperature
or add pictures. The "Online Sense HAT Emulator" is used - a programme that simulates the AstroPi computer with sensors.

Learning objectives:
* Participants know what the ISS is.
* Participants can use the humidity sensors of the Sense HAT.
* Participants can control the display of the AstroPi.
* Participants understand that colours in the RGB colour space are created by a combination of red, green and blue.

Participants need:
* Computer or tablet
* Internet connection
* Browser (Chrome)
* Microphone and speakers
* [Instructions from the RaspberryPi Foundation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/de-DE/projects/astro-pi-mission-zer)
* [Help for selecting RGB colours](https://rgbcolorcode.com/)
