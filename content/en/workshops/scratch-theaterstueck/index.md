In the online workshop "Dramas with llamas", participants gain an insight into
how to make simple animations with Scratch.
The focus of the workshop is on characters speaking and interacting with each other - just like in a theatre play.
To ensure that what is said does not overlap, the interaction must be planned in terms of timing:
who says what for how long, and so who waits how long?
More advanced participants learn how to synchronise the interaction of the characters more efficiently,
how to use Scratch's "send" and "receive" commands.

Learning objectives:
* Participants will be able to control the speech bubbles of characters in Scratch.
* Participants will be able to insert speech pauses in Scratch in a targeted manner
* Participants can synchronise the actions of Scratch characters using messages.

Participants need:
* Computer or tablet
* Internet connection
* Browser (Chrome) or Scratch app
* Microphone and loudspeaker
