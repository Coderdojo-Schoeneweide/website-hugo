## What is the aim of CoderDojo Schöneweide?
CoderDojo Schöneweide is an organisation that aims to teach children and young people about programming in a fun way.
You can find a short teaser video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NylDKr9dBdE).

## Can my child take part?
Yes.

However, it would be helpful if they can already read. We also have an upper age limit of 17 years (17 years is ok, 18 is not).
After that, you are welcome to join as a mentor :)

## How can my child take part?
If you want to take part, you can order a ticket for an upcoming workshop [here](https://pretix.eu/dojosw/).
If no workshops are currently displayed, there are no workshops planned in the near future.

## How do I find out about new workshops?
Workshops are always announced via our social media channels: [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dojosw/) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/718850878757889/user/100077465803284/)

We also send out an e-mail newsletter with the next workshops about once a month. Simply send an email to `schoneweide.berlin@coderdojo.com` and briefly mention that you would like to be added to the parent newsletter.

## Where and when do the workshops take place?
The workshops are usually on Saturdays from 11:00-13:00.

With a few exceptions, the workshops take place on the grounds of the Berlin University of Applied Sciences (HTW).
We meet before the workshops downstairs at the gatekeeper (at the information desk in front of building B). You can find a map [here](https://www.htw-berlin.de/campus/campus-wilhelminenhof/).

Our soldering workshops take place in the [xHain](https://x-hain.de/en/) near Warschauer Straße.

## How can I imagine a workshop?
At the beginning, the mentors briefly introduce themselves. If time permits, the children can also introduce themselves.
There is often a topic or a specific programme that we look at in the respective workshop (e.g. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Processing](https://processing.org/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)).

Sometimes we suggest things that can then be tried out, but there are rarely fixed goals.
Instead, the children usually automatically look for their own goals as soon as they have tried out a few things.

At the end, each child can show what they have achieved in the time available. We call this "showtime".

## Where does the CoderDojo come from?
Our dojo started as a student initiative at the University of Applied Sciences and is run by students and former students.
We are now also a proud non-profit organisation.

Our dojo is one of many worldwide. The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoderDojo) or the [official CoderDojo page](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/What-is-CoderDojo) will tell you more.
In Berlin there is also the [CoderDojo-Friedrichshain](https://www.facebook.com/coderdojoberlin/), the [CoderDojo-Red and Blue](https://coderdojo.red/) and the [CoderDojo-Potsdam](https://www.facebook.com/CoderDojoPotsdam).
