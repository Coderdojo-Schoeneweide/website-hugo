Despite the beautiful weather, we spent this Saturday morning indoors. This time we got straight into our projects without any introductions. New game elements were added to almost finished games. Games that had just been thought up were started again.

If you want to implement certain game mechanics, Scratch is the perfect foundation, just like designers who focus on character development or future authors who want to tell their story in a playful way. The biggest project - a Discord chat bot - runs in Python.

The best thing about our meeting: Everyone has the chance to see what others are working on! The exchange comes naturally. What story are you telling? What are you drawing? Finally, after the final presentation, “can I play again?”

For some, the two hours were just right, others would have liked even more time. It's good that we can meet again next month for coding in the dojo. :)
